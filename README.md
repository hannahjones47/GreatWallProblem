# 🏰 The Great Wall Problem – C++ Algorithm Implementation  

This project is a **C++ implementation** of an algorithm designed to reconstruct the **original sequence of symbols** from a collapsed wall, following the logic of the **Great Wall Problem**. Developed as part of my university coursework, this project focuses on efficient **data structures, test-driven development (TDD) and performance evaluation**.  

## 🔹 What It Does  
✅ Implements the **Great Wall Problem algorithm** in C++  
✅ Uses **custom container data structures** (no STL containers allowed)  
✅ Follows a **test-driven development (TDD) approach** with Boost unit tests  
✅ Measures and evaluates **performance using empirical data**  

## 📊 Algorithm Analysis & Performance Evaluation  
A detailed **Analysis Report** is included, which explores:  
📌 **Algorithm and data structure choices** using **asymptotic notation**  
📌 **Performance trade-offs** and complexity analysis  
📌 **Empirical performance evaluation** using real-world test data  

## 🏆 Why It Matters  
This project demonstrates **efficient algorithm design**, **custom data structures** and the importance of **performance evaluation in software engineering**. It highlights my ability to **apply theoretical concepts to practical problems** while following **best practices in software development**.

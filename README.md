# 🏰 The Great Wall Problem – C++ Algorithm Implementation  

This project is a **C++ implementation** of an algorithm designed to reconstruct the **original sequence of symbols** from a collapsed wall, following the logic of the **Great Wall Problem** (full description can be found below). Developed as part of my university coursework, this project focuses on efficient **data structures, test-driven development (TDD) and performance evaluation**.  

## 🔹 What It Does  
✅ Implements the **Great Wall Problem algorithm** in C++  
✅ Uses **custom container data structures** (no STL containers allowed)  
✅ Follows a **test-driven development (TDD) approach** with Boost unit tests  
✅ Measures and evaluates **performance using empirical data**  

## 📊 Algorithm Analysis & Performance Evaluation  
A detailed **Analysis Report** is included, which explores:  
📌 **Algorithm and data structure choices** using **asymptotic notation**  
📌 **Performance trade-offs** and complexity analysis  
📌 **Empirical performance evaluation** using real-world test data  

## 🏆 Why It Matters  
This project demonstrates **efficient algorithm design**, **custom data structures** and the importance of **performance evaluation in software engineering**. It highlights my ability to **apply theoretical concepts to practical problems** while following **best practices in software development**.

## 🧱 Great Wall Problem - Full Description

> A long time ago, a great wall was built along the northern border of an ancient kingdom. After the wall was finished, an artist walked along the wall from west to east, decorating the southern side of each top brick with a unique symbol. The artist's apprentice was instructed to follow and copy each symbol onto the northern side of each brick. However, the apprentice made a mistake. Instead of copying each symbol onto the back of the same brick, the apprentice actually copied the symbol onto the back of the next brick along. That is, he drew the symbol from southern side of the first brick onto the northern side of the second brick, the symbol from the southern side of the second brick onto the northern side of the third brick, and so forth all the way along the wall. When he reached the eastern end, he realised his mistake, as there was no brick on which to draw the final symbol. In panic, he removed the first brick from the wall, and destroyed it. The years passed, and the local people gave names to the symbols decorating the wall. They carved these names beneath the symbol on (both sides of) each brick. Many years later, an earthquake shook the kingdom, and the wall came crashing down. Saddened, the King ordered all of the decorated bricks to be brought to his palace. Upon examining the heap of bricks, the Royal Data Scientist observed that it was readily apparent which was the north and south side of each brick, as exposure to sunlight had caused the symbols on one side of the wall to fade more than the other. Thus there was enough information to efficiently determine the original sequence of symbols.
